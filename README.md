## FAQ

#### ***How does message filtering work?***

When you recive a text message from a number that is not in your contact list, Simply Filter SMS will filter it based on the following rules:
* If a text message contains text matching to a filter from the 'Allowed Texts' it will be delivered regularly.
* If not, the message will be scanned for matching filters from the 'Blocked Texts' and in case any were found it will be delivered to the Junk folder.
*  If the text doesn't contain any text that matches the filters, it will be delivered regularly.

#### ***Are my messages exposed to the app developer?***

No. Simply Filter SMS does not collect any information whatsoever, all message processing is done locally on your device without any logging.

#### ***What about iMessages and messages from my contacts?***

Apple does not expose those messages to any developer, they remain completely private.

#### ***Where are the filtered messages?***

When a text message is tagged as junk it will still be available for reading on the Messages app under the Junk folder.

#### ***What's the difference between Junk/Transactions/Promotions folders?***

Not much, you can filter any word to any folder. Those folders are not customable in any way. Only messages filtered to the Junk folder will be delivered silently.

#### ***How does Automatic Filtering work?***

Automatic Filtering is using a pre defined list of terms to determine if a message should be sent to the Junk folder or not. The lists are updated periodically with new terms. Your regular filters are still considered when Automatic Filtering is on.
